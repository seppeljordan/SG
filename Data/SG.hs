-- | A small geometry library, with vectors, matrices and simple shape
-- collision detection that is intended to be straightforward in two and three
-- dimensions.
--
-- The basics of vectors are in the "Data.SG.Vector" module, the basics of lines
-- and geometry tests (e.g. testing whether a point is on a line) are in "Data.SG.Geometry",
-- with further specialised tests in "Data.SG.Geometry.TwoDim" and "Data.SG.Geometry.ThreeDim".
--  Matrix transformations are in "Data.SG.Matrix" and shapes (with collision detection)
-- are in "Data.SG.Shape".
--
-- The names for most of the types in this library end with a prime.  This is because
-- it is intended that you specialise these types (usually to Float or Double)
-- in your application as follows:
--
-- > type Point2 = Point2' Double
-- > type Rel2 = Rel2' Double
-- > type Line2 = Line2' Double
-- > type Matrix22 = Matrix22' Double
--
-- Much of the use of the types (especially vectors) in this library is made
-- using type-classes such as Num, Functor, Applicative and so on.  For more
-- explanation on some of the less well-known type-classes, see either the
-- article Typeclassopedia in The Monad Reader
-- (<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/The_Monad.Reader>) issue 13
-- (<http://www.haskell.org/sitewiki/images/8/85/TMR-Issue13.pdf>), or my own notes
-- at <http://www.twistedsquare.com/haskell.html>.
--
-- To understand what various functions will actually do, look at the SGdemo project
-- (<http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/SGdemo>)
-- on Hackage (and its code) which provides a visual demonstration of several of
-- the functions.
